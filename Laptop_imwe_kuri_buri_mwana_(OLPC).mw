'''One Laptop per Child''' ('''OLPC''') (''Laptop moja kwa Mtoto'' in Kinyarwanda) lisilo mpango imara kwa lengo la shirika kubadilisha kwa watoto duniani kote; lengo hili lilikuwa ni kupatikana kwa kujenga na kusambaza vifaa elimu kwa [[nchi zinazoendelea|zinazoendelea duniani]], na kwa kujenga programu na bidhaa kwa ajili ya vifaa wale.

Its primary goal continues to be to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries to have access to content, media and computer-programming environments. At the time that the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so it was infeasible to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support.

The OLPC project has been the subject of extensive praise and criticism. It was praised for enabling low-cost, low-power machines; for assuring consensus at ministerial level in many countries that computer literacy is a mainstream part of education; for creating interfaces that worked without literacy in any language, and particularly without literacy in English. It has received criticism both specific to its mission, and criticism that is typical of many such systems, such as support, ease-of-use, security, content-filtering and privacy issues. Officials in some countries have criticized the project for its appropriateness in terms of price, cultural emphasis and priority as compared to other basic needs of people in third-world settings.
