Angle Trisection ( 
Example 11. Suppose I have the circle x2+z2=250.  Above in the circle, if get the points E=(-13,-9) , Z=(13,-9) , H=(-5,-15) and K=(5,-15) , then we have the isosceles trapezoid EZHK with EZ//HK and with paper and pencil we find  EH=HK=KZ=10. We know that at equal chords we have equal arcs and so the angle EPZ=55,3o divided in three equal angles. You make the shape


Example 10. Suppose I have the circle x2+z2=2197.  Above in the circle, if get the points E=(-46,-9) ,Z=(46,-9) , M=(-26,39) and N=(26,39) , then we have the isosceles trapezoid MNZE with MN//EZ and with paper and pencil we find  EM=MN=NZ=52. We know that at equal chords we have equal arcs and so the angle ETZ=101,07o divided in three equal angles. You make the shape 

Example 9. Suppose I have the circle x2+z2=186096252.  Above in the circle, if get the points E=(-16685856,-8240167) , Z=(16685856,-8240167) , H=(-6741600,-17345575) and K=(6741600,-17345575) , then we have the isosceles trapezoid EZHK with EZ//HK and with paper and pencil we find  EH=HK=KZ=7060200. We know that at equal chords we have equal arcs and so the angle EPZ=63,72o divided in three equal You make the shape
