'''Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti''' ('''IGF''') ni urubuga ruhurirwamo n'abantu b'ingeri zinyuranye bafite aho bahurira n'ibikorwa bya IG baganira cyane ku bibazo by'ingamba za politiki y'[[Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti]]<ref>[http://www.intgovforum.org/ Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Ishyirwaho rya IGF ryatangajwe ku mugaragaro n'Umunyamabanga Mukuru w'[[umuryango w'Abibumbye]] muri Nyakanga 2006 nyuma ritangira gukora mu Ukwakira/Ugushyingo 2006.

==Imiterere n'Imikorere==

Ishyirwaho ry'Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti was first recommended in the report of the [[Itsinda Rikurikirana iby'Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti]] following a series of open consultations. This report was one of the inputs to the second phase of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunis in 2005, which formally called for the creation of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) and set out its mandate.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, para 72]</ref>

Nyuma y'inama yari igamije kwegera uwo ariwe wese ufite icyo yamara muri iki gikorwa yahamagajwe muri Gashyantare 2006, Umunyamabanga Mukuru wa ONU yashyizeho Itsindangishwanama, MAG mu magambo ahinnye, n'Ubunyamabanga buhoraho n'inkingishingiro za IGF.

These organizational divisions should not be considered concrete since the organizational structures will continue to be adjusted and to be changed until they fit into the needs of the members.

===Itsindangishwanama rigizwe n'abantu b'ingeri zinyuranye bashishikajwe n'iki kibazo - MAG  ===
Itsindangishwanama, now referred to as the MAG (Itsindangishwanama rigizwe n'abantu b'ingeri zinyuranye bashishikajwe n'iki kibazo) was set up by the former Umunyamabanga Mukuru of the United Nations, Mr [[Kofi Annan]] on Gicurasi 17, 2006<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2006/sga1006.doc.htm Press Release By the UN<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>. The MAG was originally made up of 46 Members from international [[government]]s, the commercial private sector and public civil society, including [[academic]] and [[technical]] communities, and was chaired by [[Nitin Desai]], the Secretary-General’s Special Adviser for the World Summit on the Information Society. All stakeholders participate as equals. The purpose for which the MAG was set up was to assist the Umunyamabanga Mukuru in convening the Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti. On August 20, 2007 the mandate of the MAG was renewed<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/pi1791.doc.htm Press Release by the UN<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> with a new structure of 47 members, and a Co-Chairmanship by Nitin Desai<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.intgovforum.org/ADG_members.htm List of Itsindangishwanama Members<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and Burezili (Brazil)ian diplomat Hadil da Rocha Vianna<ref name=autogenerated2 />.The mandate of the MAG was further extended in Mata 30, 2008<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/pi1829.doc.htm Press Release By The UN<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> with a renewed one third of its members within each stakeholder group and Nitin Desai serving as the sole Chairman<ref name=autogenerated2 />. 
MAG iterana inshuro eshatu buri mwaka - muri Gashyantare, Gicurasi no muri Nzeri. All three meetings take place in Jeneve kuri Paledenasiyo (Palais des Nations) and they are preceded by open consultations meeting.

==Amateka n'ishyirwaho ry'Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti==

===Gukurikirana imyanzuro yavuye muri WSIS===

Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) is considered an important development of the Inama mpuzamahanga kubyerekeye Umuryango Ukungahaye ku Makuru (WSIS). This important outcome was reaffirmed by paragraphs 37 and 38 of the Tunis 2005 Commitment. Paragraph 37 states that <i>“…goals can be accomplished through the involvement, cooperation and partnership of governments and other stakeholders, i.e. the private sector, civil society and international organizations, and that international cooperation and solidarity at all levels are indispensable if the fruits of the Information Society are to benefit all.”</i><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/7.html World Summit on the Information Society. [2005]. The Tunis Commitment [online]. Available from: http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/7.html<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Corollary to this commitment, paragraph 38 states, too, that all efforts from here on <i>“should not stop with the conclusion of the Summit…emergence of the global Information Society to which we all contribute provides increasing opportunities for all our peoples and for an inclusive global community…we must harness these opportunities today and support their further development and progress.”</i><ref>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/7.html Ibid.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Inama Mpuzamahanga y'i Tunisi yo mu mwaka w'2005 made significant headway when the mandate of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) was formulated. In paragraph 72 of the Tunis Agenda, the UN Secretary-General was asked to convene a meeting hagamijwe ku the new multi-stakeholder Urubuga, otherwise known as the IGF. In this mandate, different stakeholders are encouraged to strengthen engagement, particularly those from developing countries. In paragraph 72(h), the mandate focused on capacity-building for developing countries and the drawing out of local resources.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.pdf World Summit on the Information Society. [2005]. Tunis Agenda for the Information Society [online]. Available from: http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.pdf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This particular effort, for instance, has been reinforced through <i>Diplo Foundation’s</i> Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti Kongerera Ubushobozi Abakoresha Interinet (Capacity Building) Programme (IGCBP) that allowed participants from different regions to benefit from valuable resources with the help of regional experts in IG. <ref>[http://www.diplomacy.edu/ig Read further on Diplo's "Activities" on "Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti" available from: http://www.diplomacy.edu/ig <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The involvement of different stakeholders in the policy framework of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) is a re-affirmation of commitment as per paragraph 39 of the Tunis Commitment. In this particular context, there is a deep resolve to <i>“…develop and implement an effective and sustainable response to the challenges and opportunities of building a truly global Information Society that benefits all our peoples.”</i> <ref name=autogenerated1 /> During the OECD Civil Society-Organized Labour Urubuga held last Kamena 16, 2008, in Seoul, Korea, Ambassador David A. Gross of the US Department of State talked about the transformation of the Internet in the social lives of people. He believed that this transformation made an impact in the free flow of information that politically drives challenges. Ambassador Gross commented on the 2005 WSIS because of the powerful language used on paragraph 4 of the Tunis agenda that reiterated on Kuba buri wese ashobora kuyagiraho uruhare (Openness). <ref>[http://www.diplomacy.edu/ig/communityblog.asp Read further on the community blog of Diplo Foundation, specifically on OECD impressions: http://www.diplomacy.edu/ig/communityblog.asp<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Ishyirwaho rya IGF===

A multi-stakeholder’s approach was reiterated in ubuhuzabikorwa bwa international activities for the IGF. This adaptation was set from paragraphs 29 to 35 of the Tunis agenda. These stakeholders were defined as coming from governments, the private technical and economic sector, civil society, intergovernmental organizations, and international organizations. In paragraph 32, the UN Secretary-General was commended for his efforts in establishing the Itsinda Rikurikirana iby' Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti (WGIG).

The suggested need of an organization like Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) was first pointed out in the WGIG Report. After reaching a clear consensus among its members the WGIG proposed in paragraph 40 of the Report that : 

<blockquote>''"(t)he WGIG identified a vacuum within the context of existing structures, since there is no global multi-stakeholder Urubuga to address Internet-related public policy issues. It came to the conclusion that there would be merit in creating such a space for dialogue among all stakeholders. This space could address these issues, as well as emerging issues, that are cross-cutting and multidimensional and that either affect more than one institution, are not dealt with by any institution or are not addressed in a coordinated manner”.''</blockquote>

Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) was one of four proposals made in the report. 

The idea of the Urubuga was also proposed by Argentina, as stated in its proposal <ref>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/pc3/working/dt18.html Argentina´s Urubuga Proposal in WSIS]</ref> made during the last Prepcom 3 in Tunis:

<blockquote>''"(t)In order to strengthen the global multistakeholder interaction and cooperation on public policy issues and developmental aspects relating to Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti we propose a Urubuga.  This Urubuga should not replace existing mechanisms or institutions but should build on the existing structures on Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti, should contribute to the sustainability, stability and robustness of the Internet by addressing appropriately public policy issues that are not otherwise being adequately addressed excluding any involvement in the day to day operation of the Internet. It should be constituted as a neutral, non-duplicative and non-binding process to facilitate the exchange of information and best practices and to identify issues and make known its findings, to enhance awareness and build consensus and engagement. Recognizing the rapid development of technology and institutions, we propose thkuri Urubuga mechanism periodically be reviewed to determine the need for its continuation.”''</blockquote>

The convening of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) was announced on 18 Nyakanga 2006, with the inaugural meeting of the Urubuga being held in [[Athens, Greece]] from 30 October to 2 Ugushyingo 2006.

==Inshingano n'Ibyitezwe kuvamo==

The mandate of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) is principally that of a discussion Urubuga for facilitating dialogue between the participants. Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) Gicurasi "identify emerging issues, bring them to the attention of the relevant bodies and the general public, and, where appropriate, make recommendations", but does not have any direct decision-making authority<ref>[http://www.intgovforum.org/mandate.htm Mandate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

The following activities take place kuri IGF:
inama nyunguranabitekerezo, Best Practice Urubugas, Open Urubugas and meetings of the Dynamic Coalitions.

A new theme was introduced in IGF Burezili (Brazil): critical Internet resources being one of the most debatable topics in the IG field kuri moment.

=== Amatsinda y'abibumbiye hamwe ===

The most tangible results of the first IGF in [[Athens]] are a number of so-called ''Dynamic Coalitions''<ref>[http://www.intgovforum.org/Dynamic%20Coalitions.php Dynamic Coalitions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. These coalitions are relatively informal, issue-specific groups consisting of stakeholders that are interested in the particular issue.

Most coalitions allow participation of anyone interested in contributing. Thus, these groups gather not only academics and representatives of governments, but also members of the civil society interested in participating on the debates and engaged in the coalition's works.

Kugeza ubu, Amatsinda y'abibumbiye hamwe akurikira yamenyeshejwe kandi azwi n'Ubunyamabanga bwa IGF:

=== Amanama y'ingenzi ===

The main sessions were developed according the 5 themes chosen for this year: Critical Internet Resources, Kugira ubushobozi bwo kugera ku makuru wifuza (Access), Kuhasanga amakuru anyuranye (Diversity), Kuba buri wese ashobora kuyagiraho uruhare (Openness) and Umutekano w'amakuru yo kuri Interineti (Security).

Please see below the summary of the main sessions:

==== Opening Ceremony/Opening Session ====

The multistakeholder approach were highlighted by many speakers and panelists during the Opening Session, including the message from the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, which was read by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, M. Sha Zukang.

M. Ban Ki-Moon assures that it is not a UN goal to take over Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti but only offers an opportunity to get together people with the same interest in a global reach. <ref> Available at: http://www.intgovforum.org/Rio_Meeting/IGF2-opening-12NOV07.txt (page 1)</ref>

M. Sha Zukang concludes thkuri IGF was a unique experience because “it brings together people who normally do not meet under the same roof”. <ref>Available at: http://www.intgovforum.org/Rio_Meeting/IGF2-opening-12NOV07.txt (page 2)</ref>

Development were also a key discussion in IGF-RIO, as the theme chosen for this meeting, including the breaking of digital divide, which becomes the theme for the next IGF: ''Internet for All.''

The nature and prospective of Urubuga ku micungire n'imiyoborere ya Interineti (IGF) were also discussed, as the Chairman properly summarizes<ref name=autogenerated3 />:
 
<blockquote>  ''“Abantu benshi bitabiriye ubwo butumire bavuga ko IGF atari gusa urubuga rwo kuganira, ahubwo ari n'umuyoboro ushobora gutiza umurindi ihinduka ry'ingenzi ku rwego rw'ibanze mu rwego rwo kongerera abaturage ubushobozi, build capacity and skills enable the Internet`s expansion, thereby contributing to economic and social development.''"</blockquote>

There were four themes proposed: 

(i)	'''demand and supply side initiatives''' (by Robert Pepper). He brought into debate the economic concept of demand and supply applied to Imicungire n'Imiyoborere ya Interineti. On the demand side, there were interesting proposals, such as the need for educating trough capacity-building Internet users, the ability of people controlling their web ID (part of educating the usage in Internet), local content in local languages (enforcing local community) and improving public policies (but not over regulating, such as prohibiting or limiting Kugira ubushobozi bwo kugera ku makuru wifuza (Access) to VoIP, which can suppress the demand). On the supply side, there were the common concern of extending Internet users/Kugira ubushobozi bwo kugera ku makuru wifuza (Access), but also considering ''“the opportunities created by the release of spectrum through the switch to digital broadcasting were highlighted. Some speakers suggested that such spectrum could be used to support new broadband networks and support new investment and innovative services, while Ibindis held the view that this would not be a sustainable solution.”'' <ref name=autogenerated3 /> 

(ii)	'''ibibazo mbonezamubano, ibijyanye n'umuco na politiki bya Web 2.0''' (bizakorwa na Andrew Keen); 

(iii)	'''kugera ku isoko y'amakuru''' (by'umwihariko muri Afurika, bizakorwa na Nii Quaynor) na 

(iv)	'''guhanga ibishya, ubushakashatsi n'amajyambere''' (bizakorwa Robert Kahn). 

AnIbindi challenge was to discuss emerging issues in a global Urubuga with different perspectives, for example, developed and developing countries realities; democratic and non-democratic political regimes, etc.
