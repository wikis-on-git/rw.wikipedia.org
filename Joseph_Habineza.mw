Mr Joseph Habineza, 
Kigali: The Minister of Culture and Sports, Joseph Habineza(from tribe HUTU) resigned his portfolio which he has been holding for nearly six years(since 2005) following circulation of pictures on the internet portraying indiscretion to the person of the Minister.

According to people close to him. he is a hardworker and likes joung girls as well, as it can bee seen on the following link(http://www.leprophete.fr/actualit%C3%A9s-ad/joseph-13-02-11/)

Apart from being the Minister, he was regarded by some as spy in Hutu community for Kagame regime. For Rwanda ruling party RPF and Kagame regime, this man has no more role to play  as Kagame potential enemies are emerging  nowadays his tribe, Tutsi, and not from the Hutu since Tutsi army generals and high officials left the Country (Kayumba Nyamwasa, Karegeya and many)

In order to get rid of him, the Rwanda ruling party has trapped him by young and beautiful girls,and this can been seen from youtube as well(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK7JcamsjXg)
