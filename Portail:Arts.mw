== '''Various leadership styles.''' ==

==                  Definition of a leadership: ==
'''Leadership''' is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or [[organization]] to "lead" or guide other individuals, [[Team|teams]], or entire organizations.

Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.

==        Definition of a leader: ==
'''A leader''' is "a person who influences a group of people towards the achievement of a goal".

Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new.

==          Leadership style: ==
'''Leadership style''' is the manner and approach of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. 

We have covered 12 different types of ways people tend to lead organizations or other people. Not all of these styles would deem fit for all kind of situations, you can read them through to see which one fits right to your company or situation.

=== 1. Autocratic Leadership ===
Autocratic leadership style is centered on the boss. In this leadership the leader holds all authority and responsibility. In this leadership, leaders make decisions on their own without consulting subordinates. They reach decisions, communicate them to subordinates and expect prompt implementation. Autocratic work environment does normally have little or no flexibility.

=== 2. Democratic Leadership ===
In this leadership style, subordinates are involved in making decisions. Unlike autocratic, this headship is centered on subordinates’ contributions. The democratic leader holds final responsibility, but he or she is known to delegate authority to other people, who determine work projects.

'''The most unique feature of this leadership is that communication is active upward and downward'''. With respect to statistics, democratic leadership is one of the most preferred leadership, and it entails the following: fairness, competence, creativity, courage, intelligence and honesty.

=== 3. Strategic Leadership Style ===
Strategic leadership is one that involves a leader who is essentially the head of an organization. The strategic leader is not limited to those at the top of the organization. It is geared to a wider audience at all levels who want to create a high performance life, team or organization.

The strategic leader fills the gap between the need for new possibility and the need for practicality by providing a prescriptive set of habits.  

=== 4. Transformational Leadership ===
Unlike other leadership styles, transformational leadership is all about '''initiating change''' in organizations, groups, oneself and others.

Transformational leaders motivate others to do more than they originally intended and often even more than they thought possible. They set more challenging expectations and typically achieve higher performance.

=== 5. Team Leadership ===
Team leadership involves the creation of a vivid picture of its future, where it is heading and what it will stand for. The vision inspires and provides a strong sense of purpose and direction.

Team leadership is about working with the hearts and minds of all those involved. It also recognizes that teamwork may not always involve trusting cooperative relationships. The most challenging aspect of this leadership is whether or not it will succeed. According to Harvard Business Review, team leadership may fail because of poor leadership qualities.

=== 6. Cross-Cultural Leadership ===
This form of leadership normally exists where there are various cultures in the society. This leadership has also industrialized as a way to recognize front runners who work in the contemporary globalized market.Organizations, particularly international ones require leaders who can effectively adjust their leadership to work in different environs. 

=== 7. Facilitative Leadership ===
Facilitative leadership is too dependent on measurements and outcomes – not a skill, although it takes much skill to master. The effectiveness of a group is directly related to the efficacy of its process. If the group is high functioning, the facilitative leader uses a light hand on the process.

On the other hand, if the group is low functioning, the facilitative leader will be more directives in helping the group run its process. An effective facilitative leadership involves monitoring of group dynamics, offering process suggestions and interventions to help the group stay on track.

===<u>8. Laissez-faire Leadership</u>===

===''The leader allows the employees to make the decisions, however, the leader is still responsible for the decisions that are made.''===

===''A laissez-faire leader lacks direct supervision of employees and fails to provide regular feedback to those under his supervision. Highly experienced and trained employees requiring little supervision fall under the laissez-faire leadership style. However, not all employees possess those characteristics. This leadership style hinders the production of employees needing supervision. The laissez-faire style produces no leadership or supervision efforts from managers, which can lead to poor production, lack of control and increasing costs.''===

=== 9. Transactional Leadership ===
[null The transactional leader works through creating clear structures whereby it is clear what is required of their subordinates, and the rewards that they get for following orders. Punishments are not always mentioned, but they are also well-understood and formal systems of discipline are usually in place.]

=== 10. Coaching Leadership ===
Coaching leadership involves teaching and supervising followers. A coaching leader is highly operational in setting where results/ performance require improvement. Basically, in this kind of leadership, followers are helped to improve their skills. Coaching leadership does the following: motivates followers, inspires followers and encourages followers.

=== 11. Charismatic Leadership ===
In this leadership, the charismatic leader manifests his or her revolutionary power. Charisma does not mean sheer behavioral change. It actually involves a transformation of followers’ values and beliefs.

Therefore, this distinguishes a charismatic leader from a simply populist leader who may affect attitudes towards specific objects, but who is not prepared as the charismatic leader is, to transform the underlying normative orientation that structures specific attitudes.

=== 12. Visionary Leadership ===
This form of leadership involves leaders who recognize that the methods, steps and processes of leadership are all obtained with and through people. Most great and successful leaders have the aspects of vision in them.

==        Forces that influence the style to be used include: ==
#''Amount of time available.''
#'' Are relationships based on respect and trust or on disrespect?''
#'' Who has the information—you, the employees, or both?''
#''How well your employees are trained and how well you know the task''
#''Internal conflicts''
#'' Stress levels.''
#''Type of task, such as structured, unstructured, complicated, or simple?''
#''Laws or established procedures, such as OSHA or training plans''
