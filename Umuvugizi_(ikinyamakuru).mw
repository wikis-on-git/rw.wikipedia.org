Umuvugizi: The Voice of Rwanda
/Ikinyamakuru kivugira abaturarwanda<ref>www.umuvugizi.com</ref>

'''Umuvugizi''' is a Rwandan satire news source. It is a Kinyarwanda bi-monthly newspaper and instant publishing website in both Kinyarwanda and English featuring satirical and sensational articles almost exclusively on political issues and events in Rwanda. Umuvugizi started as a highly critical newspaper but became increasingly erratic and satirical against the Rwandan government, its leadership and the president. Together with its sister newspaper, Umuseso, the main focus of their articles was that there was going to be another genocide soon, preditions about eminent military coups and so on. It was suspended at least twice by the Rwanda Media High Council for "inciting public disorder" and defamation in breach of the media law, and its editor was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison by the Supreme Court on the same charges. 


Since last year (2010) Umuvugizi publishes its satirical articles almost solely on its website and the English page started in June 2011. The articles of Umuvugizi mix both fictional, imagined and real events in and about Rwanda or any world news and information and uses it to support its claims about leadership failure in the country, conspiracies about corruption, murders and attempted murders by the country's political and military leadership, calls for war to oust the president etc. It prefaces all its articles as information from "credible sources". It has recently started to post fictional audio recordings on its website about assassination attempts by the government against its opponents and claims it sources the audio records from both Rwandan and unnamed Foreign Countries' Intelligence Services. 

Umuvugizi articles capitalise on explaining and predicting news and events in Rwanda and never revisits its false claims when the events it tries to link to each other prove untrue as is always the case.
